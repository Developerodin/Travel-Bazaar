                India hosts significant biodiversity with respect to the rest of the world. There are a number of wild life sanctuary parks set up all over the sub-continent to preserve the fauna.<br />
                Kanha National Park in Madhya Pradesh, for example, is 2,000 sq km in size and has a horseshoe-shaped valley, and grasslands surrounded by the Satpura Mountains, standing at heights ranging between 450 and 900m. In 1933, Kanha was established as a sanctuary and declared a National Park in I955. The park has a rare species of barasingha, which live in a hard-ground habitat.<br />
                Nestling in the foothills of the mighty Himalaya, another national park called the Corbett Tiger Reserve lies mainly in the hilly districts of Nainital, Almora and Pauri Garhwal. At present the tiger reserve covers an area of 1318.54sqkm and is home to around 580 bird species, 50 mammals and at least 25 reptile species, including the
                Indian python, cobra and krait. Another wildlife treasure chest can be found at the Kaziranga National Park which means where the mountain goat has water'. Tall elephant grass covers most of the land, sometimes opening into foraging grounds with shorter grasses, few tall trees and cane thickets. Today there are over 1,500 rhinos in Kaziranga and it Is also home to over 70 per cent of the world's swamp or wild buffalo population. According to a recent census, Kaziranga sustains over a 1,000 wild elephants and 450 species of wetland, grassland and woodland birds, of which 18 are globally threatened.
                Another major attraction would be the up market wildlife theme lodges that also arrange jungle safaris.<br />
                Organized by the CC Africa with the Taj Hotels, the Mahua Kothi. In the Bandhavgarh National Park, and also the Baghvan at the Pench National Park are some of the must-stay lodges that bring you as close to nature and all the wild action and shouldn't be missed. The overall experience provided by CC Africa is not only of international standards, but will ensure a truly memorable introduction to India's Wildlife.<br />

                Bollywood consists of the languages of Hindi, Urdu and English. There has been a growing presence of Indian English in dialogue and songs as well. It is not uncommon to see films that feature dialogue with English words and phrases, even whole sentences.

              The Rambagh Palace in Rajasthan, for example, has a royal history before its conversion into a Heritage Hotel in 1972. Other palatial destinations that one would not want to miss out on are the Lake Palace and the Umaid Bhawan Palace. The Lake Palace is a dream of white marble and mosaic glistening in the moonlight. The palace in the middle of Lake Pichola is spread over a 40-acre site and has been continuously lived in for the past two and half centuries. Jodhpur’s Umaid Bhawan Palace is the last of India’s great palaces and with an expanse of 26 acres, it is one of the largest residences in the world. Since all the visitors are treated like the Maharajah’s personal guests, you get to enjoy the taste of royalty in its entire original flavor as guests of honor.

Built in 1156, Jaisalmer Fort is the second oldest of Rajasthan’s major forts after Chittorgarh. Mounted atop Trikuta, the fort rises like a sunbeam from the desert, 250 feet tall, and is reinforced by an imposing crenellated sandstone wall 30 feet high. It has as many as 99 bastions, 92 of which were built between 1633 and 1647 to be used as gun platforms. The view of the 99 bastions of the yellow sandstone fort, the desert citadel of Raja Jaisal, is spectacular to behold. <br>

             Religion plays a major role in the Indian way of life. Based on your religious preferences, there are plenty of soul enriching experiences that take place across India. The recently opened Ram Mandir, a magnificent temple devoted to Lord Rama, is in Ayodhya, a city of great religious significance to Hindus. This ornately carved monument designates a major place of pilgrimage. Buddhism is one of the most rising spiritual preferences that that have risen in India. So much so that celebrities like Madonna and Richard Gere are common visitors to the country looking for divine upliftment. Buddhism is an Indian religion founded in North India and based on the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, also known as the Buddha. Varanasi is a historical city in northern India which is sacred to Hindus and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. In many ways Varanasi epitomizes the very best and worst aspects of India, and it can be a little overwhelming. However, the scene of pilgrims doing their devotions in the river Ganges at sunrise set against the backdrop of the centuries old temples is probably one of the most impressive sights in the world - a must-see destination on any trip to northern India. Nalanda in Bihar marks the site of the once famous Buddhist University. Nalanda was a Buddhist university established in 450CE and was the longest running university in Indian history. Among its many notable guests were the Buddha and Mahavira, and at its zenith accommodated over 10,000 students and over 2,000 faculty. Madurai is one of the major cities in Tamil Nadu and home to the Meenakshi Temple. It is also known as the Temple City of India. It is also called "Thoongavoor", which means sleepless city. <br>

              Considered by some to be the world's most diverse cuisine, each family of this cuisine is characterized by a wide assortment of dishes and cooking techniques. Though a significant portion of Indian food is vegetarian, many traditional Indian dishes also include chicken, goat, lamb, fish, and other meats. Beef is not eaten by most Hindus.
Food is an important part of Indian culture, playing a role in everyday life as well as in festivals. In many families, everyday meals are usually sit-down affairs consisting of two to three main course dishes, varied accompaniments such as chutneys and pickles, carbohydrate staples such as rice and roti (bread), as well as desserts. Indian cuisine varies from region to region, reflecting the varied demographics of the ethnically diverse subcontinent. Generally, Indian cuisine can be split into four categories: North Indian, South Indian, East Indian, and West Indian. Despite this diversity, some unifying threads emerge in the art of Indian cuisine. Varied uses of spices are an integral part of food preparation and are used to enhance the flavor of a dish and create unique flavors and aromas. 
Several customs are associated with the manner of food consumption. Traditional serving styles vary from region to region in India. A universal aspect of presentation is the thali, a large plate with samplings of different regional dishes accompanied by raita, breads such as naan, puri, or roti, and rice. In South India, a cleaned banana leaf is often placed under the food as decoration.
In addition to the endless list of gastronomical journeys in India, you also have an impressive list of wines to wash it all down with. India is a fast-growing destination on the brewery map with white wines like the Chateau d'Ori's 2007 Cabernet Syrah being among the fine wines. With impressive vineyards in Nashik, wine tours are not an uncommon attraction when planning a holiday to India.

              India is famous for its handicrafts and ethnic crafts items. Other popular shopping items that are taken by tourists include Indian spices, Indian tea, pickles of different flavors, exotic perfumes and knick knacks from different states. 
Goa is the perfect place to shop for souvenirs and those little knick-knacks that never seem to run out of fashion. The best places to hunt for these are the flea markets of Goa. The most famous flea market of Goa is the Anjuna flea market. Apparently, this market was started off by the hippies many years back. Today the flea markets are the favorite haunt of locals as well as tourists. One can find everything and anything in these flea markets. Not just clothes and souvenirs, one can also find enthusiastic musicians, tarot readers, palmists, etc. sitting here and there to amuse tourists. You will find an unusual collection of jewelry, antiques, wooden articles and leatherware and general bric-a-brac at the famous Chor Bazaar in Mumbai. Try to bargain with the traders and you will normally strike a good deal with them. Another market worth visiting is the Crawford market, also in Mumbai, which is famous for its variety of flowers, fruits and meat and also makes a good picture to be captured in your camera.
The overcrowded lanes of Kolkata (previously known as Calcutta) still have the old trams that play in this beautiful city. Kolkata has its own share of different government emporiums and cottage emporiums located at the Chowringhee Lane. You can find wonderful handicrafts from all states over here.
